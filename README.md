Organ transplantation is a life-saving medical prac-
tice that relies on sound coordination and timely distribution
between the available donor organs and respective recipients.
Both these aspects, in fact, constitute the fulcrum of such
operations: minimizing the time needed to transport the organ in
order not to lose its viability and prioritizing patients accurately
according to the urgency of their medical condition. The current
paper represents TransplantExpress-a novel software solution
that merges algorithmic route optimization with state-of-the-
art patient management. Using Dijkstra’s algorithm, the system
computes the shortest and most efficient delivery routes, sharply
reducing transport times and improving organ viability. Also,
TransplantExpress will incorporate a machine learning algorithm
that will serve to assess the level of criticalness in transplant
candidates based on different medical parameters: age, blood
type, organ type, and case history. The ML model comes up
with a criticalness score to help doctors provide more efficient
prioritization so that the person who is in urgent need gets the
organ as soon as possible.Key features are secure user authenti-
cation, efficient patient and organ management, real-time status
updates on delivery. Extensive testing of the TransplantExpress
system shows significant gains both in route optimization and
in prioritizing patients. The system can perform an average cut
of X% in the time taken for delivering the organ and a 79%
accuracy rate in predicting the patient’s criticalness as compared
to a manual process.
